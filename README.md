# pyCALIOP

This is a personal project to develop a python library to open,
process and plot CALIOP data, the lidar on board the CALIPSO satellite
from NASA.

There is very little code for that shared here on GitHub, and most
seem like old projects not maintained anymore. The best resource is
definetly ccplot (https://github.com/peterkuma/ccplot), but it is
aimed at L1 data and doesn't handle the vertical feature mask (VFM).
Whenever possible
